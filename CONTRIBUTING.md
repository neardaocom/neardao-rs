## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [NearDAO Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [dev@gneardao.com](mailto:dev@gneardao.com).

## What should I know before I get started?

### Architecture

We recommend to read at our [NEARDAO documentation](https://info-128.gitbook.io/neardao/) to get familiar with the project.

### Development tools

We recommend to use VSCode with rust-analyser extension but any other IDE is ok as it supports this extension (eg. CLion by JetBrains).
Docker is necessary to be able to build the code as we use dockerized contract-builder to build it.
In general any x86-64 machine with decent computing power should be ok. The new Apple Silicon machines might now work with integration tests. Workspaces-rs doc [here](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs#m1-macos) mentions this issue.
