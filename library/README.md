### Expression
- kind of interpreter over primitive types
- enables to evaluate runtime expressions

###Â Utils
- provides functions to validate/bind/serialize almost any structure of json object defined by schema

### Storage
- defines storage structures

## TBD: 
1. FnMetadata schema
2. Storage deposit for self
3. Optimalizations all kinds in general
4. Crate module structure
5. Workflow validation tests
